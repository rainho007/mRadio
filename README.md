# mRadio
A micro program based on wechat.

This is a side project which is designed to satisfy my personal needs.

When I chat with my friends using wechat, I always want to listen to some random music, but I don't want to open another app.
So the right time is come when wechat provide the ability to develop apps within the wechat itself.

The name "mRadio" is based on two words, 'm' stands for "my" or "micro". "Radio" is also a radio, obviously.

Wish you like it and enjoy listening music when chatting with your best friends.
